                    <p>Red Bull Racing is owned by Red Bull GmbH, an Austrian energy drink company.
                        The team has been a major player in Formula 1, particularly during the dominant years of Sebastian Vettel, who won four consecutive drivers' championships from 2010 to 2013.

                    <h3>Max and Sergio</h3>
                    <p> Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez were teammates at Red Bull Racing in Formula 1. They became teammates for the 2021 season, with Perez joining the team to replace Alexander Albon. Both drivers had expressed their willingness to work together and contribute to Red Bull's performance in the championship.

                        Their relationship at the beginning of the 2021 season appeared positive, with both drivers aiming to support each other in the team's pursuit of success. However, the dynamics between teammates can evolve over a season based on their on-track performances, team dynamics, and various other factors.</p>
